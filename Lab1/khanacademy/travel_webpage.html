  <p class="start">Despite being located inside the Arctic Circle, Norilsk has a subarctic climate (Köppen: Dfc;
    Trewartha: Ecld) with very long, extremely cold winters (from early October to May) and very short, mild summers.
    Norilsk experiences negative temperatures for about 240 days a year, and snow cover lasts from seven to nine months,
    with more than 50 days of snowstorms.[49] Strong winds are common. The average temperature in January is about −27
    °C (−17 °F).

    The midnight sun is above the horizon from May 20 to July 24, and the time when the sun does not rise, polar night,
    lasts from approximately November 30 to January 13.[51]

    Summer is short (mid-July) and cool, with an average July temperature 14-15 °C (58 °F), though temperatures can
    sometimes rise above 25 °C (77 °F).

    Norilsk has an average annual air temperature of −8.3 °C (17.1 °F), with an annual variation of absolute
    temperatures of 85 °C (153 °F). The average annual relative humidity is about 76%.

    Although Norilsk is located south of the arctic tree line, much of the surrounding area is naturally forest tundra,
    and there are few trees in the city itself.
